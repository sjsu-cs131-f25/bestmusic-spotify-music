Dataset Used: [zaheenhamidani's "Spotify Tracks DB" dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db/data)

This dataset captures metrics regarding the characteristics of Spotify music tracks across 26 different genres, with roughly 8-10k tracks per genre. 
Important characteristics that we may look at could include:
- Genre
- Popularity
- Duration
- Acousticness
- Liveliness
- Tempo
and more...

These different kinds of information about music can help us keep track with what kind of trends is popular, as songs can both become hits right after its release or gain popularity far afterwards through social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

Some questions that this dataset poses and can potentially help answer are:
- How important is X characteristic within a track Y's popularity?
- What similarities can we see between genre A and genre B's general musical characteristics?
- Why are some songs popular while not following the general trend for characteristics?
- How much impact does an artist's name have on the popularity of their tracks?
- Can we see the style of an artist by seeing the average characteristics of all their tracks?
