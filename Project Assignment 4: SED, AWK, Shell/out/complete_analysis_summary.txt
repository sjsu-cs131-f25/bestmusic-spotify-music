# Complete Spotify Music Data Analysis Pipeline - Summary Report

## Analysis Overview
This comprehensive analysis pipeline processes Spotify music data through six distinct parts:

### Part A: Data Cleaning and Quality Assessment
- SED-based data cleaning and normalization
- Before/after data quality samples generated
- Whitespace normalization and character encoding cleanup

### Part B: Frequency Analysis
- Genre frequency distribution analysis
- Artist frequency distribution analysis
- Sorted frequency tables with counts

### Part C: Top-N Lists
- Top 10 most popular tracks by Spotify popularity score
- Top 10 tracks with highest tempo (BPM)
- Ranked lists with track names, artists, and metrics

### Part D: Statistical Aggregation and Skinny Tables
- Artist-level metrics: average popularity, energy, danceability
- Genre-level aggregated statistics with counts and averages
- Comprehensive skinny tables for downstream analysis

### Part E: Temporal/String Structure Analysis
- Track name length distribution bucketing
- Duration bucketing (temporal-like structure analysis)
- Case normalization analysis for duplicate detection
- String structure pattern analysis

### Part F: Signal Discovery
- Keyword family analysis in track names
- Z-score outlier detection for statistical anomalies
- Genre signal pattern analysis
- Text and numerical column signal discovery
