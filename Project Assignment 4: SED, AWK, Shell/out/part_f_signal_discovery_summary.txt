# Part F: Signal Discovery Analysis Summary

## Overview

This analysis performs comprehensive signal discovery on both text and numerical columns to identify patterns, outliers, and meaningful signals in the Spotify dataset.

## Text Column Analysis

### 1. Case-Folding Analysis
- Analyzes genre case-folding patterns using tolower()
- Identifies potential case inconsistencies in genre names
- Reveals data quality issues through case normalization

### 2. Keyword Family Analysis
- Extracts common music keywords from track names
- Identifies thematic patterns in song titles
- Reveals popular lyrical themes and concepts

### 3. Surface Top Signals
- Analyzes frequency of appearance in genres
- Identifies dominant genre signals
- Reveals genre distribution patterns

### 4. Artist Name Pattern Analysis
- Identifies naming conventions in artist names
- Analyzes structural patterns (e.g., "The", "feat.", initials)
- Reveals artist naming trends

## Numerical Column Analysis

### 5. Statistical Distributions
- Calculates min, max, mean, and standard deviation for numerical columns
- Provides comprehensive statistical overview
- Identifies data ranges and central tendencies

### 6. Outlier Detection
- Uses z-score analysis (threshold: |z-score| > 2)
- Identifies statistical outliers in key metrics
- Flags unusual tracks for further investigation

### 7. Categorical Comparisons
- Compares averages across genres
- Reveals genre-specific characteristics
- Identifies genre patterns in numerical metrics

### 8. High Percentage Threshold Analysis
- Uses percentage-based thresholds for outlier detection
- Identifies extreme values in key metrics
- Provides business-relevant thresholds
